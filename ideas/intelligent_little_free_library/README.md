Intelligent Little Free Library(ies) (22 Oct 2015)
---

It would be nice to implement some book regonisers using a raspberry pi and a camera
to understand how many people contribute with other books, how much time does a person 
spend browsing the books. 

Maybe for a network of Libraries, the quesions would be:
which is the most activite spot of these libraries?
