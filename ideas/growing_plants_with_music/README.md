Growing plans with music (26 October 2015)
---

Plants are known to respond to light, wind, and soil nutrients. 
Some gardeners believe flowers can be revitalised by music.
They found that sounds at specific frequencies - 125Hz and 250Hz - made genes rbcS 
and Ald more active, whereas sound waves at 50HZ made their less active.
As both are known to respond to light, they repeated the experiments in the dark and 
concluded the sound was causing the effect.
The researchers speculated that the production of chemicals that lead to the genetic 
changes they observed could be harnessed to activate other specific genes that could 
trigger the flowering of crops.
Other scientists were more sceptical. Martin Parry, of the Institute for Arable Crops 
Research-Rothamsted in Harpenden, said factors such as wind might drown out the effects
 of the sound.
Philip Wigge of the John Innes Centre in Norwich said he did not trust the results of the study, 
saying too few samples had been analysed.
