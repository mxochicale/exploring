Smart Chair (somewhere in 2014-2015)
---

I got this idea in 2014 after starting my PhD.
Essentially, as a researcher you spend many time sitting and it is well know 
that sitting would damage your body more than smoking [attach references here]
using some figures about the percentage of deaths.
With that in mind, a smart chair using force sensor in the chair can tell you 
when you have to stand up, when to go back and even it can punish you.
All these data can be saved in a server and then used by your doctor to diagnose 
any healthy problem.



# TODO
