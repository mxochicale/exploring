Acousting Signature Recognition
---

* This might be an interesting project, using some low-cost microphones,
attached to a raspberry PI3 and put them in a house or in an open environment,
like a public, to learnt about the busy hours, noise contamination, but 
to mention but a a few. JUNE2015

* I also thought to recognise gait patterns in a corridor and learn 
new gait patterns and reinforces the common ones. JUNE2015
