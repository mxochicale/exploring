# Exploring Scientifically
In my day to day, I bump into a new concept(s), author(s), graphical result(s) or theory(ies) which sometimes I (re)tweet at [@_mxochicale](https://twitter.com/_mxochicale).
Few of those explorations leads to a bit more systematic explaration that is raised as [issues](https://github.com/mxochicale/exploring/issues).
