Exploring Scientifically
---

In my day to day as a explorer of the Internet, I bump into a new concept(s), 
author(s), graphical result(s) or theory(ies) and what I have been doing to this
day is only tweeting these random references at [@_mxochicale](https://twitter.com/_mxochicale). 
However, this time I want to put a bit of organisation to all I bump into
and those random thoughts that come up in this set of neural networks that juggles a lot.
